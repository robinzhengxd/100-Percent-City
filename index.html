They are recognized as being among the leaders and creators of the theatermovement known as Reality Trend (Theater der Zeit), which has exerted a powerful influence on the alternative theater scene. Their aim is to break open our reality, showing it in all its facets as a way of enabling us to interrogate it. </p>

   		<h2> How Did We Come Up With Rimini Protokol? </h2>
   </div>
    
   <div class="col-sm-5">
   		<p style="padding-top: 30px"> Our office is in Hebbel am Ufer Theater in Berlin. We’ve been artists in residence here for almost 10 years now. So, when we look out our window, we see Kreuzberg. It’s a neighborhood of Berlin, where almost half of the inhabitants are from Turkey, and the rest of them are punks and artists from overseas looking for cheap studio spaces.
After our first two years of collaboration, we were forced to be baptized. It was a deadline for a publication in 2001. We were told that every being needs a name! We’re interested in protocols – we follow them, we research them, we write them. “Rimini” just sounded like a suitable first name!
So “Rimini Protokoll” was born as a label for the works of Helgard Haug, Stefan Kaegi and Daniel Wetzel.
Some people call us documentary theater makers, but we like to think of ourselves, as people who constantly try to expand the limits of what can be understood as theater.

    <p> The process of the casting for the shows is this snowball game of generating statistical data about the city and its population. Apart from the five statistical criteria we use to generate the census grid that everyone on stage has to fit within, one of the hidden filters that we apply on top is that theater enthusiasts or actors should not be part of the cast more than a proper mirror of the census would allow, which tends to be not more than one or two percent. 

You don’t easily get 100 people together for many rehearsals. Especially as most of them have jobs and other commitments. But we can do with about 5 rehearsals of 4-5 hours. Rehearsals don’t include any kind of text-learning or actors training. People just have to be who they are, focus on what’s being said and follow some instructions that are prompted. As we insist on them getting paid by the theater a small fee, we can also expect them to commit and be there. </p>

   		<p style="padding-top: 30px"> Could you explain your decision to gather participants through word of mouth and challenges faced? Yes, sometimes it’s only possible to mention an obvious lack and thus to mention the limits of the game we played. The rules must break at some point. Or do you know somebody from Bangladesh who is a lone-parent between 60 and 70 years old and lives in the opposite corner of the city you live in? Probably only some dozens of citizens match those criteria. So we have to help. We go through engaged communities in certain neighborhoods or – depending on the age group – we contact homes for the old, or schools. On stage we address the struggle to find people because it tells us something about the city, too. </p>
